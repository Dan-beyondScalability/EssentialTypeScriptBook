# Introduction

I'm Jess Chadwick and in this book I'll be guiding you through the ins and outs of the TypeScript programming language. 

Put simply, TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, which means that it builds on top of JavaScript's mature foundations, adding a variety of helpful syntax and tooling onto the language.  It brings the power and productivity of static typing and object-oriented development techniques to the core JavaScript language.  In fact, TypeScript is designed to be compiled into fully-compatible JavaScript.
 
And, as JavaScript's reach continues to expand, so do the opportunities to leverage TypeScript to create JavaScript-based applications.

In this book, I will show you everything you need to know in order to create full-fledged JavaScript applications using the TypeScript programming language, starting by revisiting some JavaScript fundamentals and proceeding all the way to demonstrating how to convert an entire existing JavaScript codebase to take full advantage of what TypeScript has to offer.

One of the nicest things about TypeScript is that its tooling is fully cross-platform, which means that you can develop TypeScript applications using Windows, Mac, or even Linux.  Microsoft even offers an online editor to play around with in order to get your feet wet without having to install anything at all! 

We've got a lot to cover, so if you're ready to get started, let's move right on to the next video where I'll set some expectations about what you'll need to know first in order to get the most out of this course.
